## Postman collection and environment
This folder includes a Postman collection and environment.
The collection includes endpoints for login and CRUD enpoints for `Notes` and `Folders`.

Public api doc generated from the postman collection is accessible at `https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/13468044/UVkvKCmp`

* The environment already includes the login credentials that are seeded in the Notes-api application database.
* Successfull Login automatically sets `ACCESS_TOKEN` variable, so there is no need to change AUTH header.
